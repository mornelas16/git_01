You’re winning. You simply cannot fail.  
The only obstacle is doubt;  
There’s not a hill you cannot scale  
Once fear is put to rout.  

Don’t think defeat, don’t talk defeat,  
The word will rob you of your strength.  
“I will succeed,” This phrase repeat  
Throughout the journey’s length.  

The minute that “I can’t is said –  
You slam a door right in your face.  
Why not exclaim, “I will” instead?  
Half won then is the race.  

You close the door to your success  
By entertaining one small fear.  
Think happiness, talk happiness,  
Watch joy then coming near.  

The word “impossible” is black.  
“I can” is like a flame of gold.  
No whining, heart! Eyes! look not back;  
Be strong, O Will! and bold.
